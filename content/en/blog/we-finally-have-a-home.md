It's official: today we signed the lease contract for a commercial space right in the city center!

It's a relatively big commercial space, at the ground floor, in a very central area. This space should be
more than enough for our initial community, with room to spare for growing and hosting larger events in the future.

The place is very close to the main subway station that serves the city center, *Vittoria*. It's only a 4-minute walk from there. It's
also close to the train station, at around a 9-minute walk.

The full address is **Contrada del Cavalletto, 24, Brescia**[^1].

There's still a bit of work left to do before we'll be able to open to the public, but this was one of the most critical tasks and being
done with it means we are making a huge step forward.

We are now looking into furnishing the office and if everything goes smoothly we should be able to host a grand opening event in the month
of March. If you don't want to miss it make sure you are subscribed to our [mailing list]({{< ref "mailing-list" >}})!

Want to help? We are looking for used furniture (desks, office chairs, shelves, couches) to fill up the place. If you live closeby and have
something you want to get rid of, we'll be happy to come pick it up :)

For everybody else: just hang tight, we'll be ready soon!


[^1]: Writing this blog post we realized OpenStreetMap doesn't know where the number 24 is located on that road. We'll submit a fix soon!
