hack.bs is a non-profit [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Brescia, Italy. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other
like-minded individuals. We are a space for hackers, designed by hackers.

We plan to regularly host workshops, meetups, hackathons and more, open to the public.

We are funded through voluntary contributions from individuals and private companies: if you want to support our project you can also [make a donation]({{< ref "donate" >}}).
We have a [transparency]({{< ref "transparency" >}}) page to show exactly how we allocate our funds.
